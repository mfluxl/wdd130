<img src="profile1.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Matt Felber" width="400">
<p> Hello, world. I am very excited to be taking this web development course! I grew up in Brazil and spent the majority of my life here. I'm a hard worker who strives to be better than I am.
    I am married to a beautiful and pristine woman that I admire and love. I want to learn to code and create great things because it is highly gratifying, and most importantly, 
    so that I can take care of my family. I've always enjoyed studying technology, but I'd never had the chance to learn in this manner, in a formal setting, with a clearly defined intention,
    so I would like to take this opportunity to learn this set of valuable skills and apply them in a positive way.

    <h2>Brazil</h2>
    <img src="https://image.bnews.vn/MediaUpload/Org/2021/12/17/shutterstock-1283691793-1-20211217083314.jpg" alt="Rio Pic">
    <p>Here is a picture of Rio, in Brazil. The country has a lot of land, with country areas, as well as bigger cities that resemble NY.
        The country's boarders are consistent of other south american countries, and its geography consists of very tricky to navigate highlands. 
        
        Geopolitically this makes it a very tough country to invade by external physical forces. The majority of the population is very mixed,
        so separatism is not as big an issue as other countries. The people are extroverted, warm, and vibrant. It is a good place for tourism,
        though the crime rate is still high in dense cities. 

        Just as dye imbues fabric with color, our brazilian culture shapes our character and essence.</p>
