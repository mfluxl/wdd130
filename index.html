    <h2>Brazil</h2>
    <img src="https://image.bnews.vn/MediaUpload/Org/2021/12/17/shutterstock-1283691793-1-20211217083314.jpg" alt="Rio Pic">
    <p>Here is a picture of Rio, in Brazil. The country has a lot of land, with country areas, as well as bigger cities that resemble NY.
        The country's boarders are consistent of other south american countries, and its geography consists of very tricky to navigate highlands. 
        
        Geopolitically this makes it a very tough country to invade by external physical forces. The majority of the population is very mixed,
        so separatism is not as big an issue as other countries. The people are extroverted, warm, and vibrant. It is a good place for tourism,
        though the crime rate is still high in dense cities. 

        Just as dye imbues fabric with color, our brazilian culture shapes our character and essence.</p>
